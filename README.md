# Numerical gravitational spin Hall equations


## TODO:
- [ ] Add support for the cross product norm to determine at which point the geodesic is straight (give some tolerance)
- [ ] Calculate how close that straight line passes to a target location (the impact parameter)
- [ ] Add support for the increase of tau along the straight line
- [ ] Add some solver that minimises the impact parameter
- [ ] Document the code that does the translation from mathematica
- [ ] Create a chain class
