# Numerical gravitational spin Hall equations


## TODO:
- [ ] Add least squares to determine at which point the geodesic is a straight line
- [ ] Calculate how close that straight line passes to a target location (the impact parameter)
- [ ] Add how tau behaves along the straight line
- [ ] Add some solver that minimises the impact parameter
