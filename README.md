# Gravitational spin-Hall effect

The gravitational spin-Hall effect (GSHE) describes the frequency and spin-dependent trajectories of wavepackets, such as gravitational-waves emitted from a binary black hole merger, propagating in strong gravitational fields as described in [1]. We calculate the GSHE-induced deviations from a null geodesic and the observed detector strain for a gravitational wavepacket. 


## TO-DO
- [ ] When plotting time differences remove 0.0, if any (since we plot log).
- [ ] Correct the conversion to observer proper time.
- [ ] When looping over arrays stop assuming $s=\pm 2$ when summarising results.
- [ ] Add an example notebook to calculate the deviations.


## Things to be resolved later
- [ ] GW emitter anisotropy
